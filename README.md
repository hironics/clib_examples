=============

Examples on how to use c standard library. I have included as many functions or Macro as possible for each header file. There are still some funtions missing from the examples. It might be because of C version.

By far, I only include C90. Some libraries such as stdbool is part of C99, therefore are not covered by this exercise. 

### Headers
####assert
assert.h defines one macro function that can be used as a standard debugging tool

####ctype
This header declares a set of functions to classify and transform individual characters.
Major functions are in two sets
* is* functions used to check if char falls in certain type
* to* functions used to convert upper case to lower case and vice verse

####errno
C Header that defines macro: 
< errno

####float
####limits
####locale
####math
####miscellaneous
####setjmp
####signal
####stdarg
####stdbool
####stddef
####stdio
####stdlib
####string
####time
